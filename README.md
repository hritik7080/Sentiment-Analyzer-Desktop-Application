# Sentiment-Analyzer-Desktop-Application
This is a GUI that analyzes the sentiments of a review dataset and shows the report with a piechart of sentiments and also sends the report on the user's email. I have used Deep Learning LSTM to predict the sentiment of any sentence up to 84 words.
GUI is simple and shower adn responsive.
